scrumblr
========

what is it
----------
[scrumblr](http://scrumblr.ca) is a web-based simulation of a physical agile kanban board that supports real-time collaboration. it is built using node.js, websockets (using socket.io), CSS3, and jquery. i hope you like it.

use scrumblr
------------

if you'd like to use scrumblr go to [scrumblr.ca](http://scrumblr.ca). new boards are made simply by modifying the url to something unique. e.g. your team could use a shared board at: *http://scrumblr.ca/thisisoursecretboard23423242*

if you want to host a on-demand version for e.g. meetups or presentation you can run `docker-compose --build -d`. the application is then reachable via `localhost:7000`.

alternatively, you can follow the instructions below to setup scrumblr yourself. it is very simple -- it just uses redis and node.js.

if you are a developer, please fork and submit changes/fixes.

browser support
---------------

scrumblr works on up to date chrome and firefox browsers. enable websockets for optimal performance. tested mainly on chrome for osx. this was not designed for browser support. use chrome for this app.

design philosophy
-----------------
my goal was to avoid buttons and ui (almost everything is edit in place or draggable). everything should be discoverable (no "help"). the look is meant to be as close as possible to [Well.ca's](http://well.ca) real sprint board. see picture below. many of the decisions were to make the app look and feel as much as possible like well.ca's real sprint board -- you may find this annoying but we find it kinda funny.

how to install and run on your own computer (linux/osx)
-------------------------------------------------------

- [install redis](http://redis.io/download) (last tested on v2.8.4)
- [install node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (last tested on v0.10.30)
- install npm (if you're running node.js [v0.6.3](https://github.com/joyent/node/commit/b159c6) or newer it's already installed!)
- cd to the scrumblr directory; you should see server.js and config.js and other files.
- run `npm install`
- run redis `redis-server`
- run scrumblr `node server.js --port 80` where "80" is the port you have opened in your firewall and want scrumblr to run on. 
- open a browser to `http://<server>:<port>` where `<server>` is your server's url or IP address, and `<port>` is the port you chose in the previous step.
